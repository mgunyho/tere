# To render parts of the built-in help screen, tere reads the README file at
# compile time and splits it at runtime by newlines \n. This breaks on Windows
# if using the default Git setting of using CR+LF instead of just LF. Here we
# specify that the README should always be checked out as LF to avoid this
# (it's simpler to do this way than to change the program logic to handle both
# CRLF and LF).

README.md text eol=lf

# This is raw output from the program, don't do any conversions on it
